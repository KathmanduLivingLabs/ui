# ui
An ocassionally curated UI/UX repository. 

> The idea here is to bring together UI related resources that can serve as a starting point for fellow UI designers. Please note that we will be constantly experimenting in the way we categorize resources. 

Here are some recsources that we have found to be interesting, useful or both in the past:

1. *UI Design starts with words*, [an interesting article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/how-do-you-design-interaction/) that suggests and interesting way to immerse yourself into the product you're designing.
2. *UI Patterns for filtering data* , a detailed [analysis](https://baymard.com/blog/horizontal-filtering-sorting-design) that delves into UI patterns that work when designing filters.
